        <h2>Student:Henry Flores-Acosta</h2>
        <h3>Briefly Describe Or Define:</h3> 
        <ol>
            <li>Computer Network:Computers connected together for the purpose of sharing personal communications, hardware and software resources, and information. </li>
            <li>Analog Device Define And Give An Example:</li>
            <li>Digital Device Define And Give An Example: Digital devices including mobile phones, cameras, speakers, video game consoles, and your automobile’s sound system. Bluetooth is a popular tech- nique for implementing what is termed a personal area network (PAN), a collection of privately owned interconnected digital devices all located in close proximity.</li>
            <li>Modem:modulates, or alters, a standard analog signal called a carrier wave so that it encodes binary information. The modem modifies the physical characteristics of the carrier wave, such as amplitude or frequency, so that it is in one of two distinct states, one state representing 0 and the other state representing 1.</li>
            <li>Bandwidth:A range of frequencies within a given band, in particular that used for transmitting a signal.</li>
            <li>Ethernet:a system for connecting a number of computer systems to form a local area network, with protocols to control the passing of information and to avoid simultaneous transmission by two or more systems.            </li>
            <li>WLAN:wireless local area network (WLAN), a short-distance form of wireless networking, a user transmits from his or her computer, tab- let, or smartphone to a local wireless base station, often referred to as a wireless router, access point, or hot spot, that is no more than a few hun- dred feet away.</li>
            <li>IEEE 802.11 Wireless Network Standard:One of the most widely used standards for wireless local access is Wi-Fi, also referred to by its official name, the IEEE 802.11 wireless network standard. Wi-Fi is used to connect a computer to the Internet when it is within range (typically 150–300 feet or 45–90 meters) of a wireless base station, often advertised as a Wi-Fi hot spot
                <br>
                <br>
                - What Does IEEE Stand For?
                <br>
                
                IEEE, pronounced "Eye-triple-E," stands for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
                <br>
                <br>
                - What Is The Main Mission Of IEEE?
                <br>
                IEEE nurtures, develops, and advances the building of global technologies. As a leading developer of industry standards in a broad range of technologies, IEEE SA drives the functionality, capabilities, safety, and interoperability of products and services, transforming how people live, work, and communicate.
                - What Are The Benefits Of IEEE Membership?
                <br>
                <br>
                 When you join IEEE, you:
                <br>
                • Join a community of more than 400,000 technology and engineering professionals united by a common desire to continuously learn, interact, collaborate, and innovate
                <br>
                • Access the resources and opportunities you need to keep on top of changes in technology
                <br>
                • Network with other professionals in your local area or within a specific technical interest
                <br>
                • Mentor the next generation of engineers and technologists
                <br>
                <br>
                - What Are The Requirements For IEEE Student Membership And How Much Does Undergraduate Membership Cost Annually For Students From The USA?
                <br>
                • A Student/Graduate Student member must carry at least 50% of a normal full-time academic program as a registered undergraduate or graduate student in a regular course of study in IEEE designated fields. The total cumulative period for a member to hold the Student member grade and/or the Graduate Student member grade is limited to eight years.<br><br>
                • A Membership for Undergraduate USA Students costs $16.00


            </li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>MAN:A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area.</li>
            <li>Internet Of Things:The Internet of things describes physical objects with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks</li>
            <li>LAN:A local area network (LAN) connects hardware devices such as comput- ers, printers, and storage devices that are all in relatively close proximity (150–300 ft/45–90 m). </li>
            <li>RepeaterA repeater is a device that simply amplifies and forwards a signal. If the device connecting the two LANs is a repeater, then every message on LAN1 is forwarded to LAN2, and vice versa. Thus, when two Ethernet LANs are connected by a repeater, they function exactly as if they were a single network.:</li>
            <li>Bridge:A bridge is a “smarter” device that has knowledge about the nodes located on each separate network. It examines every message to see if it should be forwarded from one network to another.</li>
            <li>WAN:connects devices that are not in close physical proximity. Because WANs cross public property, the WAN owner must purchase telecommunications services,from an external provider.</li>
            <li>Packet And Packet Switching:In telecommunications, packet switching is a method of grouping data into packets that are transmitted over a digital network. Packets are made of a header and a payload.</li>
            <li>ISP:An Internet service provider is an organization that provides services for accessing, using, managing, or participating in the Internet.</li>
            <li>Firewall:a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</li>
            <li>Protocol:is a mutually agreed-upon set of rules, conventions, and agreements for the efficient and orderly exchange of infor- mation.</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing:the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
            </li>
            <li>Net Neutrality:The term net neutrality means that a public information network such as
                an Internet service provider (ISP) should treat all users, all platforms, and all content equally—essentially it should be operated like the water, electric, and gas companies, as publicly regulated utilities. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Briefly Describe The Five Layers Of TCP/IP (The Internet Protocol Hierarchy) :</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class = "nonum">Layer 1. Physical Layer:
                The Physical layer protocols govern the exchange of binary digits (bits) across a physical communication channel, such as a fiber-optic cable, copper wire, or wireless radio channel. These protocols specify such things as:
                <br>• How we know when a bit is present on the line
                <br>• How much time the bit will remain on the line
                <br>• Whether the bit is in the form of a digital or an analog signal
                <br>• The physical quantities used to represent a binary 0 and a binary 1
                <br>• The shape of the physical connector between the computer and trans- mission line
            </li>
            <li class="nonum">Layer 2. Data Link Layer:This layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between nodes on a network segment across the physical layer.</li>
            <li class = "nonum">Layer 3. Network Layer:The network layer is responsible for packet forwarding including routing through intermediate routers.</li>
            <li class = "nonum">Layer 4. Transport Layer:manages network traffic between hosts and end systems to ensure complete data transfers.</li>
            <li class = "nonum">Layer 5. Application Layer:the fifth layer of the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) Model, and is known as the session layer. As the name suggests, this layer is dedicated to connection sessions and is the layer that establishes and manages the connections between two or more applications.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>List And Briefly Describe At Least 3 Network Services And Benefits:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Interpersonal Communications:Email (electronic mail) has been the single most popular application of networks for the last 35 years. It is estimated that about 400 billion email messages are transmitted across the Internet every day! When the Internet was first developed, its designers thought it would be an ideal way for scientists and engineers to access important software packages and data files stored on remote computers. However, the first Internet “killer app” was rather unexpected and something quite different—email.
                Email is convenient. You can send a message whenever you want, and it waits for the recipient to log on and read at his or her convenience. Email is fast. A message from the United States typically arrives anywhere in the world in a few seconds, even though it may have to pass through 15 or 20 nodes along the way (using the packet-switched protocols described in the previous section). Email supports multimedia. The contents of your elec- tronic messages are not limited to characters but can also include a range of attachments, including photographs, text, graphics, video, and sound. Finally, email is a broadcast medium. A computer can send a letter to a thousand recipients as easily as it can send it to one. (This feature has led to an explosive growth in spam—unsolicited bulk email. It is estimated that 70% of all email on the Internet today is spam.)</li>
            <li>Electronic Commerce:Electronic commerce (or just ecommerce) is a general term applied to any use of computers and networking to support the paperless exchange of goods, information, and services in the commercial sector. </li>
            <li>Resource Sharing:Another important network service is resource sharing, the ability to share physical resources, such as a 3-D printer or massive terabyte storage device, as well as logical resources, such as software and data, among multiple users.
