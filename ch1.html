        <h3 style = "color: red; border-width: 1px; border-style:solid; border-color: red;">Three misconceptions about Computer Science</h3>
        <ol style = "color: red; ">
            <li>Misconception 1: Computer science is the study of computers.</li>
            <li>Misconception 2: Computer science is the study of how to write computer
                programs.</li>
            <li>Misconception 3: Computer science is the study of the uses and applications of computers and software.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style = "color: red; border-width: 1px; border-style:solid; border-color: red;">Briefly define:</h3>
        <ol style = "color: red; ">
            <li>Computer Science: The study of algorithms,including, thier formal and math-ematical properites, thier hardware realizations, thier linguistic realizations, and their applications.</li>

            <li>Algorithm: A well-ordered collection of unambiguous
                and effectively computable operations that, when executed, produces a result and halts in a finite amount of time</li>
            <li>Sequential operation: A sequential instruction carries out a single welldefined task. When that task is finished, the algorithm moves on to the
                next operation. Sequential operations are usually expressed as simple
                declarative sentences</li>
            <li>Conditional operation: These are the “question-asking” instructions of
                an algorithm. They ask a question, and the next operation is then selected
                on the basis of the answer to that question.</li>
            <li>Iterative operation: These are the “looping” instructions of an algorithm.
                They tell us not to go on to the next instruction but, instead, to go back
                and repeat the execution of a previous block of instructions.</li>
            <li>Stored program computer: The stored program concept, in which the instructions to be executed by
                the computer are represented as binary values and stored in memory.</li>
            <li>Programmer: A person who writes commands in a high-level language</li>
            <li>integratd circuit: Rather than using discrete electronic components, integrated
                circuits with transistors, resistors, and capacitors were photographically etched
                onto a piece of silicon, which further reduced the size and cost of computers.
                From building-sized to room-sized, computers now became desk-sized, and
                this period saw the birth of the first minicomputer—the PDP-1 manufactured
                by the Digital Equipment Corp</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 style = "color: red; border-width: 1px; border-style:solid; border-color: red;">Briefly describe these computer generations</h3>
        <ol style = "color: red; ">
            <li>First generation computer: The period 1950–1957 (these dates are very rough approximations) is
                often called the first generation of computing. This era saw the appearance of
                UNIVAC I, the first computer built for sale, and the IBM 701, the first computer </li>
            <li>Second generation computer: The second generation of computing, roughly 1957–1965, heralded a
                major change in the size and complexity of computers. In the late 1950s,
                the bulky vacuum tube was replaced by a single transistor only a few millimeters in size, and memory was now constructed using tiny magnetic cores
                only 1/50th of an inch in diameter. </li>
            <li>Third generation computer: Third generation of computing, which lasted from about 1965 to 1975. This was the era of the integrated circuit. Rather than using discrete electronic components, integrated
                circuits with transistors, resistors, and capacitors were photographically etched
                onto a piece of silicon, which further reduced the size and cost of computers.
                From building-sized to room-sized, computers now became desk-sized, and
                this period saw the birth of the first minicomputer—the PDP-1 manufactured
                by the Digital Equipment Corp. It also saw the birth of the software industry,
                as companies sprang up to provide programs such as accounting packages
                and statistical programs to the ever-increasing numbers of computer users.
                By the mid-1970s, computers were no longer a rarity. They were being widely
                used throughout industry, government, the military, and education</li>
            <li>Fourth generation computer: The fourth generation, roughly 1975–1985, saw the appearance of the
                first microcomputer. Integrated circuit technology had advanced to the
                point that a complete computer system could be contained on a single circuit
                board that you could hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>Fifth generation computer: The fifth generation, 1985–?, is where we are today. However, so much is
                changing so fast that the concept of distinct generations of computer development has outlived its usefulness. In computer science, change is now a
                constant companion. Some of the recent developments in computer systems, such as massively parallel processors containing millions of processors and
                capable of quadrillions (1015) of computations per second,Ultra-high-resolution graphics for 3D imaging, animation, movie making, video games, and virtual reality,Self-driving, computer-controlled cars and automated computerized
                robotics, etc. </li>

        <h3 style = "color: red; border-width: 1px; border-style:solid; border-color: red;">FORTRAN:</h3>
        <ol style = "color: red; ">
            <li>What does the acronym FORTRAN stand for ?:The name Fortran derives from Formula Translating System. The very name
                indicates its affiliation with “formulas” or engineering-type applications. </li>
            <li>When was FORTRAN developed?:Developed in the mid-1950s by a group at IBM headed by John Backus, in
                conjunction with some IBM computer users, the first commercial version of
                Fortran was released in 1957</li>
            <li>What was it used for ?:Early computer users were
                often engineers who were solving problems with a heavy mathematics or computational flavor. Fortran has some features ideally suited to these applications, such as the exponentiation operator we mentioned earlier, as well as the
                ability to carry out extended-precision arithmetic with many decimal places of
                accuracy, and the ability to work within the complex number system</li>
            <li>Is FORTRAN still being used today? If so, what for?:s. Fortran now runs on PCs, tablets, and
                even smartphones while still providing the power to help supercomputers
                tackle some of the most computationally intensive problems ever.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 style = "color: red; border-width: 1px; border-style:solid; border-color: red;">COBAL:</h3>
        <ul style = "color: red; ">
            <li>What does the acronym COBOL stand for ?: The name COBOL derives from COmmon Business-Oriented Language. </li>
            <li>When was COBOL developed?: COBOL was developed in 1959 and 1960 by a group headed by Admiral
            Grace Murray Hopper of the U.S. Navy</li>
            <li>What was it used for?: COBOL was designed to serve business needs such as managing inventories and payrolls.</li>
            <li>Is COBOL still being used today? If so, what for: It is still used in many financial and business applications today. </li>
        </ul>
